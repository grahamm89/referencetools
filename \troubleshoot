  "symptoms": {
    "Tannin Stains": { "causes": "Tea, coffee, red-wine tannins adhere—worse where glaze has eroded.", "actions": "Switch to a chlorinated detergent or pre-soak in Suma Shine K2. Renovate with Bactosol where possible." },
    "Starch": { "causes": "Heated plates, long holds, sticky foods, low detergent or wash pressure/temperature.", "actions": "Increase alkaline detergent, boost temp/pressure, improve pre-scraping." },
    "Foaming": { "causes": "Low wash/rinse temp, hand-dish liquid in tank, high food load, high tank level, poor rinse.", "actions": "Raise temps, reduce rinse-aid, skim foam, drain & refill, remove high-foam products." },
    "Drying Marks": { "causes": "Weak rinse, low rinse-aid, hard water, low rinse temperature, poor racking.", "actions": "Repair rinse, dose rinse-aid correctly, soften or de-ionise water, rack items angle-down." },
    "Detergent Overuse": { "causes": "Broken pump, high set-point, scaled probe, faulty fill valve.", "actions": "Calibrate/repair pump, descale probe, lower set-point, free fill valve." },
    "Limescale": { "causes": "Hard water with no/failed softener, insufficient detergent, wrong rinse-aid.", "actions": "Regenerate or repair softener, add suitable detergent, use hard-water rinse-aid." },
    "Cracking Plastic": { "causes": "Excess heat, exposure to hand-dish liquid, aggressive rinse-aid, very high chlorine.", "actions": "Lower rinse temp, remove problem chemicals, use plastic-safe range (A11/A8)." },
    "Bits After Rinsing": { "causes": "Poor rinse, dirty wash water, coffee grounds/tea bags, poor racking.", "actions": "Service rinse, refresh wash tank, improve pre-scrape, flush rinse supply." },
    "Detergent Carryover": { "causes": "Poor rinse, high detergent concentration, low rinse pressure.", "actions": "Repair rinse, dial back detergent, clear rinse jets, increase pressure." },
    "Cloudy Glasses": { "causes": "Hard-water scale, detergent carry-over, too high detergent, high dissolved solids.", "actions": "Soft water or suitable rinse-aid, optimise detergent dose, rinse pressure up." },
    "Rusty Cutlery": { "causes": "Prolonged soaking, contact with salt or strong chlorine.", "actions": "Shorten soak, rinse quickly, reduce chlorine, upgrade cutlery grade." },
    "Black SS Cutlery": { "causes": "Contact with silver-dip or excess heat.", "actions": "Keep stainless away from silver cleaner and high heat." },
    "Silver Tarnishing": { "causes": "Sulphides (eggs/fire), chlorine, heat.", "actions": "Minimise sulphide/chlorine contact, burnish, run lower temps." },
    "Machine Scaled": { "causes": "Hard-water scale from insufficient detergent in hard areas.", "actions": "Check salt & softener, descale with acid cleaner, ensure detergent dosing." },
    "Wash Jets Blocked": { "causes": "Debris blocks jets—water can’t reach ware.", "actions": "Remove & clean jets daily, flush thoroughly." }
